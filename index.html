    <h2>MY EXPERIENCE SO FAR LEARNING WEB DEVELOPMENT AND HTML</h2>
    <P>My name is programmer Tomosori Ayomide a newbie to coding and programming. I am here to share my little experience so far in learning web development and a brief introduction to html.</P>
    <p>yes so now I would like to start with;</p>
    <h3>WHAT IS A WEB</h3>
    <P>A web is actually interlinked documents in hypertext form that can be accessed via the internet. Know that web is the short word for WWW(World Wide Web) </P>
    <h2>KEY COMPONENTS OF THE WEB</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Hypertext</li>
        <li>HTTP(Hypertext Transfer Protocol)</li>
        <li>URL(Uniform Resource Locator)</li>
        <li>Web browser</li>
        <li>Web Servers</li>
    </ol>

    <h1>HOW THE WEB WORKS</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>A user enters a URL in a web browser.</li>
        <li>The browser sends an HTTP request to the web server associated with the URL inputed.</li>
        <li>The web server processes the request and returns the requested web page </li>
        <li>The browser receives the response and displays it to the user if found and when not found it displays the error  code 404</li>
    </ol>
    <p>With the little knowledge I have been able to develop a website with a little about myself. Web development is actually fun inasmuch as you put your mind in it. </p>
    <p>So right now I would be giving a little introduction to HTML as I earlier said. </p>
    <h2>INTRODUCTION TO HTML</h2>
    <p>HTML means Hypertext Markup Language </p>
    <p>HTML is the standard markup language used to create web pages it is the back bone of a website, providing the structure and content that the web browser renders to the user</p>
    <h2>BASIC COMPONENTS OF HTML</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Elements</li>
        <li>Tags</li>
        <li>Attribute</li>
    </ol>
    <p>I am sure you were enlightned on my little concept of web development and introduction to HTML.</p>
    <p>In conclusion I would say I have so far had a great experience with web development.</p>
